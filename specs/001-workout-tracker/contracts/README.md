# Service Contracts: Personal Workout Tracker App

This directory contains interface definitions for core services in the workout tracker application. These contracts define the expected behavior and data flow between different layers of the application.

## Files

- `workout_parser_service.md` - Interface for parsing workouts.md file into structured data
- `storage_service.md` - Interface for local data persistence operations  
- `timer_service.md` - Interface for workout session timing functionality
- `settings_service.md` - Interface for user preferences management

## Design Principles

All service contracts follow these principles:

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Testable Interfaces**: All methods return concrete types that can be easily mocked/tested
3. **Error Handling**: Explicit error cases and recovery strategies
4. **Asynchronous Operations**: All potentially slow operations return Futures
5. **Constitutional Compliance**: Interfaces support widget-centric architecture and clear state management

## Usage

These contracts serve as:
- **Development Guide**: Clear expectations for service implementations
- **Testing Foundation**: Interface definitions for creating mocks and test doubles
- **API Documentation**: Expected behavior and data formats for each service
- **Integration Points**: How services interact with UI components and state management
