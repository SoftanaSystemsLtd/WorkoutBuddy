# Feature Specification: Personal Workout Tracker App

**Feature Branch**: `001-workout-tracker`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a simple Gym app personally for me. I have a workouts.md file in the directory. This contains Day by day plans. Categorised by Muscle groups. I want this list to be compiled as a workout plan. I want to see on Sunday the Day1 program. Monday the next day program and so on. I want to be able to track my workout progress by selecting checkbox when I am done with a workout. I want to see a history of the done workouts anytime."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Daily Workout Plan (Priority: P1)

As a gym enthusiast, I want to see my scheduled workout plan for the current day so that I know exactly which exercises and muscle groups to focus on during my gym session.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides immediate value - without being able to view the daily workout, the app has no purpose. This creates the foundation for all other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the app on any day of the week and verifying that the correct workout plan (Day 1-4) is displayed based on the weekly schedule, delivering immediate workout guidance value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** it's Sunday, **When** I open the app, **Then** I see Day 1 workout (Back and Biceps) with all exercises organized by muscle groups
2. **Given** it's Monday, **When** I open the app, **Then** I see Day 2 workout (Chest and Triceps) with all exercises organized by muscle groups
3. **Given** it's Tuesday, **When** I open the app, **Then** I see Day 3 workout (Shoulder and Abs) with all exercises organized by muscle groups
4. **Given** it's Wednesday, **When** I open the app, **Then** I see Day 4 workout (Legs) with all exercises organized by muscle groups
5. **Given** it's Thursday, **When** I open the app, **Then** I see Day 1 workout (cycle repeats)
6. **Given** any day, **When** I view the workout plan, **Then** exercises are clearly grouped by muscle categories (e.g., Upper Back, Mid Back, Lats)

### User Story 2 - Track Workout Progress (Priority: P2)

As a gym user, I want to mark individual exercises as completed during my workout so that I can track my progress in real-time and stay motivated throughout my session.

**Why this priority**: This adds the essential tracking functionality that transforms a static workout viewer into an interactive progress tool, providing immediate feedback and motivation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing any workout plan and marking exercises as complete via checkboxes, delivering immediate progress tracking value even without history features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm viewing today's workout plan, **When** I complete an exercise, **Then** I can check a checkbox next to that exercise to mark it as done
2. **Given** I've marked some exercises as complete, **When** I continue my workout, **Then** completed exercises remain checked and uncompleted exercises remain unchecked
3. **Given** I'm mid-workout, **When** I accidentally check an exercise, **Then** I can uncheck it to mark it as incomplete
4. **Given** I've completed all exercises in a muscle group, **When** I view the workout, **Then** I can see visual indication that the muscle group is complete
5. **Given** I complete my entire workout, **When** I view the plan, **Then** all exercises show as completed with clear visual feedback

### User Story 3 - View Workout History (Priority: P3)

As a fitness tracker, I want to see a history of my completed workouts so that I can monitor my consistency, identify patterns, and stay motivated by seeing my progress over time.

**Why this priority**: This provides long-term value and motivation but is not essential for immediate workout guidance. Users can get value from tracking current workouts even without historical data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing several workouts over multiple days and then accessing a history view that shows past workout completions, delivering workout consistency insights.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have completed workouts on previous days, **When** I access workout history, **Then** I see a chronological list of completed workout sessions
2. **Given** I'm viewing workout history, **When** I select a specific past workout, **Then** I see which exercises I completed and which I skipped
3. **Given** multiple workout sessions exist, **When** I view history, **Then** I can see workout dates, muscle groups trained, and completion percentages
4. **Given** I want to track consistency, **When** I view history, **Then** I can see patterns of workout frequency and muscle group rotation
5. **Given** I haven't worked out recently, **When** I view history, **Then** I can see my last workout date to motivate return to routine

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user opens the app for the first time with no workout history?
- How does the system handle partial workout completion when the user exits the app mid-session?
- What occurs if the user changes the date/time on their device - does it affect workout scheduling?
- How does the system behave if the workouts.md structure changes or becomes corrupted?
- What happens when the user completes the same workout multiple times in one day?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display the appropriate workout plan (Day 1-4) based on the current day of the week starting with Day 1 on Sunday
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse and display workout data from existing workouts.md file with proper muscle group categorization
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to mark individual exercises as completed via interactive checkboxes
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist workout progress data between app sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a history view showing past workout sessions with dates and completion status
- **FR-006**: System MUST cycle through the 4-day workout program continuously (Day 4 followed by Day 1)
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain checkbox state during active workout session
- **FR-008**: System MUST display exercises grouped by muscle categories as defined in workouts.md structure
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle app restart/closure gracefully without losing current workout progress
- **FR-010**: System MUST store workout completion timestamps for historical tracking

### Key Entities

- **Workout Plan**: Represents a single day's workout (Day 1-4) containing multiple muscle groups and their associated exercises
- **Exercise**: Individual workout activity with name, muscle group category, and completion status
- **Workout Session**: A specific instance of completing a workout plan on a particular date with exercise completion data
- **Muscle Group**: Category grouping exercises (e.g., Upper Back, Biceps: Outer head) as defined in the existing workout structure

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view the correct daily workout plan within 2 seconds of opening the app
- **SC-002**: Users can complete exercise tracking (checking/unchecking) with immediate visual feedback under 1 second per action
- **SC-003**: 100% of workout data from workouts.md file is accurately displayed in the app interface
- **SC-004**: Workout progress persists across app sessions with 100% reliability
- **SC-005**: Users can access complete workout history within 3 seconds from any screen
- **SC-006**: App supports continuous daily use for 30+ days without performance degradation
- **SC-007**: Exercise completion state updates are reflected instantly in the user interface

## Assumptions

- The workouts.md file structure will remain consistent (4 days, muscle group headers, numbered exercise lists)
- Users will primarily use the app during gym sessions on mobile devices
- One workout session per day is the typical usage pattern
- Users prefer simple checkbox interaction over complex progress tracking
- The 4-day cycle starting on Sunday aligns with user's intended workout schedule
- Local device storage is sufficient for workout history (no cloud sync required initially)
